He generated virus sequences from respiratory samples collected from influenza virus positive cases admitted to 7 sentinel surveillance sites across Kenya between 2009 and 2018 and analysed the data using bioinformatics techniques.\nThe movie below illustrates the patterns of spread of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Kenya, 2009-2018. Countrywide, influenza viruses spread from multiple locations to multiple destinations within Kenya and between locations in proximity, with important implications for public health practice in the country. For example, they suggest that future novel strains of influenza virus may spread to multiple Kenyan locations following introduction. Thus, surveillance efforts should be concentrated in as many surveillance sites as possible for better pandemic preparedness and response.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"774dca6f620449ba763b57b42fc9b384","permalink":"https://dcollinsowuor.com/project/pandemic-flu/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pandemic-flu/","section":"project","summary":"Sequencing of pandemic influenza A viruses","tags":["influenza","A(H1N1)pdm09 virus","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2 virus","Kenya","phylogeography","spread"],"title":"Pandemic flu viruses","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The role of understudied tropical and sub-tropical countries in the global spread of influenza viruses remains unclear due to insufficient spatiotemporal sequence data from these regions.\nThe movie below illustrates the global spread of influenza A(H3N2) virus.
