Collins' research applies advanced techniques (diagnostics, genomics, and bioinformatics) in the analyses of pathogen sequence data, with the aim of developing improved diagnostics/genomics tools and bioinformatics pipelines for pathogen sequence data analysis. 

His current research interests, which aim to inform public health interventions, include molecular epidemiology of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens of public health importance.
